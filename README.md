# terminal-effects
Practicing c++, matrices and threading. Tested on Linux and Windows (version 1511 or higher required for ANSI escape code). This program runs much smoother on Linux terminal compared to Windows cmd.

4 cpu threads are altering the matrix, creating the "effects", while the 5th thread is drawing the matrix.

## TODO
* Bounce reverse doesn't go all the way up
* Create draw_matrix.h
