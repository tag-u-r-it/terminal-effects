# terminal-effects
Practicing c++, matrices and threading. Tested on Linux and Windows.

4 cpu threads are altering the matrix (creating the "effects"), while the 5th thread is drawing the matrix. This program runs much smoother on Linux terminal compared to Windows cmd.

## TODO
* Bounce reverse doesn't go all the way up
