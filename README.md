# terminal-effects
Practicing c++, matrices and threading. Tested on Linux and Windows (version 1511 or higher required for ANSI escape code). This program runs much smoother on Linux terminal compared to Windows cmd.

## Linux
User will be asked for option [1] or [2]. 1 Will be user defined matrix size. 2 will be based on the terminal size.

## Windows
Size of the matrix will be defined by the user.

### TODO
* Create draw_matrix.h
